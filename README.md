<h3 align="center"><strong>Purpose of these Onboarding Plans</strong></h3>

> Suppose a new team member joins the company. This person used a different programming language in his previous company, so needs to learn a new programming language that fits company's technology stack. ðŸ¤”

> I think we should write an onboarding plan for this member to work with us. Let's share various scenarios with collective intelligence to help many people. ðŸ¤—

<h3 align="center"><strong>Note to Beginners</strong></h3>

> Don't feel overwhelmed! Also, always ask questions if you don't know anything! It's your first time learning. ðŸ˜€

If you think that these can be improved in any way, please do suggest.
